import Image from 'astro/components/Image.astro';

From the start, we knew that we wanted an image API that felt as minimal as possible. We started with the original `<Image />` Component API from the `@astrojs/image` integration, and then built on it with a few new tweaks and changes.

<br />

```js del={2} ins={4} title="my-js-file"
---
// Import the <Image /> component
import { Image } from "astro:assets"
// Import a reference to the image itself
import myImage from "../assets/penguin.png"
---

<image src="{myImage}" alt="A very cool penguin!" />
```

<br />

But donâ€™t let the minimal API fool you:

- Astro optimizes your image using the modern WebP file format (by default).
- For accessibility, the required alt prop helps improve your site for screen-readers and other tooling.
- For even faster page-load performance, the loading and decoding attributes are added as defaults.
- For the user experience, The width and height attributes are always included to prevent layout shift (more on this later).
